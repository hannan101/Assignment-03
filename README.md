# Assignment-03 Strings
Python strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes, used to store and manipulate text. Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation, but you can perform operations like slicing, concatenation, and formatting. They are fundamental for handling textual data in Python programs.
